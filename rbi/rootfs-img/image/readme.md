# RB for rootfs

This repo aims to produce a raw disk image based on existed rootfs

## Method

Substitute oroginal osbuilder's Dockerfile to a new one, which
explicitly designed packages versions.
Then just call osbuilder's original image-builder.sh

## usage

`build-img.sh` is the main script. User should provide 3 parameters:
```plaintext
$ ./build-img.sh 
    
    This script aims to apply a patch tokata-container's 
    image_builder.sh and run it, to build a rootfs.img 
    for kata-containers.
    
    Parameters:
        - <path/to/source_code_dir> source_code_dir means dir 
            'kata-containers'
        - <path/to/rootfs/dir> rootfs, generated by ../rootfs
        - <path/to/output_dir> 

```

If properly executed, you will get output like
```plaintext
[INFO] Build Done. Artifest is <some-path>/kata-container.img.
You can check for details. 
Thank you :P
```
